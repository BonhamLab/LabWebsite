title = "Protocols and Procedures"
+++

There are many protocols and procedures in any lab,
both formal and informal,
explicit and implicit.
The most formal and explicit policies
can be found in the [Lab Code of Conduct (CoC)](/protocols/coc),
but these can be expressed informally as
do your best, be honest, and don't be a jerk.
If you are new to the lab,
also be sure to familiarize yourself with
[meetings and administration](/protocols/admin).

Everything here should be taken as a starting point for your work in the lab,
to be supplemented by conversations in one-on-one and lab meetings.
If you come upon a practice that deserves documenting
(either as something to do or as something to avoid),
don't hesitate to open a pull request to add it!
