# Bonham Lab Code of Conduct

## Lab precepts

While more extensive documentation follows,
the core principles that should govern your conduct
in the Bonham Lab are articulated here.
Everything else follows from this set of commitments.

All members of the Bonham Lab (including Kevin)
must conform to the following Code of Conduct.
If you feel you are unable to make any of these commitments,
or if you feel that any member of the lab (including Kevin)
has not lived up to them,
please raise the issue with an appropriate authority
as soon as possible.

### Three Fundamental Commitments

1. Recognizing that many tributaries feed the river of scientific knowledge,
   I will honor my own individuality and the individuality of others.
2. Realizing that science is at its core an attempt to understand the world as it is,
   I am committed to continuous learning and open exchange of ideas.
3. Acknowledging the fundamental meaning of any discovery comes from its impact on others, 
   I will respect the integrity of the global scientific community.

### Three Guiding Principles

* I will act in ways that promote scientific integrity and ethical research.
* I will cultivate excellence and continuous improvement in my scientific understanding.
* I vow to conduct research that benefits all living beings and our shared environment.
