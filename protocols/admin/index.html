  <h1 id="meetings_and_other_admin" ><a href="#meetings_and_other_admin"> Meetings and other admin</a></h1><h2 id="working_expectations" ><a href="#working_expectations"> Working expectations</a></h2><p>There is always more to do,
in both work and life,
than there is time to do it.
You are expected to work diligently during work hours,
and to limit your work hours in the ways you need to
to maintain your mental health.</p>
<h3 id="working_hours" ><a href="#working_hours"> Working hours</a></h3><p>Within reason, you may keep the working hours that make sense for you,
but keep in mind that science is a team sport,
and you should endeavor to be available, at least some of the time,
when others are working.</p>
<p>Minimally, you are expected to be consistently available for lab meetings,
your periodic group meetings with Kevin,
and any project-specific meetings,
though in all of these cases, every effort will be made to schedule these
in ways that accommodate everyone's unique schedules.</p>
<p>Kevin tries very hard to limit his own work to weekdays between 8am and 5pm.
Members of the lab may choose to work in the evenings or on weekends
in order to have more flexible schedules during the week,
but no one is expected to do so.
People working irregular hours should keep in mind that responses from Kevin
will most likely be delayed outside of typical business hours.</p>
<h3 id="communication" ><a href="#communication"> Communication</a></h3><p>Internal lab communication is done using <a href="https://bonhamlab.zulipchat.com">Zulip</a>,
which is a bit like slack, but hopefully less distracting.
Zulip has both channels and topics</p>
<ul>
<li>Channels are for very borad topics (eg <code>#meetings</code>, <code>#code-help</code>)</li>
<li>topics are like subject lines for emails. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you haven't used zulip before, please <a href="https://zulip.com/why-zulip/">read this</a> for an overview.</p>
<p>A great deal of communication may also take place on github
in the form of issues and pull-requests.
Email should only be used when including collaborators
or other folks outside of the lab.</p>
<p><strong>Expectations</strong></p>
<p>You are expected to check your zulip and github notifications
at least once or twice per workday.
More frequent communication may be expected during some
high-intensity periods,
but except in exceptional circumstances,
you will not be expected (and should not expect others)
to respond in the evenings or on weekends.</p>
<p>You are also expected to manage your own notifications
and reply schedules in ways that make sense for you.
Because people may be working different hours,
you may receive messages outside of normal working hours,
but this does not constitute an expectation of response outside of working hours.</p>
<h3 id="vacation_/_time_off" ><a href="#vacation_/_time_off"> Vacation / time off</a></h3><p>Time to rest and recharge is critical for physical and mental health.
When you plan to be away for an extended time (more than ~2 normal work days)
or during lab meetings/periodic meetings,
please inform Kevin and anyone else that works on the same projects as you
as far in advance as possible,
and set yourself as away in outlook during that time.</p>
<p>Staff, students, and fellows have different requirements
for reporting paid time off to the hospital.
Please check in with Kevin if you do not know how to do this.</p>
<h2 id="meetings" ><a href="#meetings"> Meetings</a></h2><p><strong>Expectations</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Unless otherwise stated, lab meetings will be in-person.</li>
<li>Periodic meetings may be in-person or over zoom,
  though in-person meetings are generally preferred</li>
<li>Whether in-person or remote, you are expected to be on-time,
  prepared to present (where applicable), and able to participate.<ul>
<li>Please notify everyone involved in the meeting as soon as you can
    if for whatever reason you are unable to attend,
    or if your certainty about being able to attend has changed.</li>
<li>For scheduled in-person meetings, if you are feelings symptoms of a cold or other communicable illness,
    please inform others as early as you can that you need to switch to a remote meeting</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Be respectful of other people's time and schedules</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="staff_and_trainee_periodic_meetings" ><a href="#staff_and_trainee_periodic_meetings"> Staff and Trainee Periodic Meetings</a></h3><p>Everyone in the lab should have periodic one-on-one meetings
with Kevin to discuss your personal plans and goals,
any roadblocks or issues that you are encountering,
and just generally to check in.</p>
<p>Most often, "periodic" means once per week or every other week,
though depending on your working style and need for support,
you may increase or decrease this frequency in consultation with Kevin.</p>
<p>Before your first meeting,
create your personal repository from the <a href="https://github.com/BonhamLab/TraineeTemplate/">trainee template</a>,
then follow the instructions in the README within the <code>PeriodicTemplate</code> directory.
If you're not sure how to do this,
try taking a look at the <a href="/protocols/code">writing code protocol</a>.
If you still can't figure it out,
Kevin can help during your first meeting.</p>
<h3 id="lab_meeting" ><a href="#lab_meeting"> Lab Meeting</a></h3><p>Most weeks,
there will be a lab meeting with everyone in the lab participating.
If you have lab business to discuss,
find the lab meeting agenda
and add it as a bullet point.</p>
<p>The goal of lab meetings is to build community
and help everyone have a sense of what the other lab members are working on,
not to be completely polished.</p>
<h4 id="weekly_progress_(every_week)" ><a href="#weekly_progress_(every_week)"> Weekly progress (every week)</a></h4><p>Each member of the lab should be prepared to present at least one thing
that you would like help with or feedback on,
but this can take many forms.
Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>a plot or data visualization you've created</li>
<li>a bug that you encountered in analysis code (whether solved or not)</li>
<li>a paragraph or two from the results section
  of a manuscript you are working on</li>
<li>a figure from a paper you read that you need help interpreting</li>
</ul>
<p>The point of this is <strong>not</strong> to have a fully fleshed out product,
but to demonstrate what you are working on and share your struggles along with your successes.</p>
<h4 id="paper_snippets_(every_week)" ><a href="#paper_snippets_(every_week)"> Paper snippets (every week)</a></h4><p>Each week, you should share something from a paper that you read.
Implicitly, this means you should be reading at least one paper per week.
Note: you do not need to completely or even mostly understand what you read,
just do your best to understand the overall goal of the paper,
and if you can't, be able to talk about what's confusing.</p>
<p>Also be sure to log the paper that you read and a brief description
in your personal trainee repository.</p>
<p>TODO: baserow form or shared obsidian vault for keeping track of papers</p>
<h4 id="research_presentation_(once_every_6_8_weeks)" ><a href="#research_presentation_(once_every_6_8_weeks)"> Research presentation (once every 6-8 weeks)</a></h4><p>A critical component of doing science is presenting science.
About every two months (scheduled in advance),
you will prepare a more formal presentation of your work.</p>
<p>Lab members that are not presenting in a week should take notes
and provide feedback on content, style, and / or clarity of the presentation.</p>
<p>TODO - training resources for preparing effective presentations.</p>
<h4 id="journal_club_(once_every_6_8_weeks)" ><a href="#journal_club_(once_every_6_8_weeks)"> Journal Club (once every 6-8 weeks)</a></h4><p>Occasionally, you will be asked to present a paper in more detail than your weekly snippet.
You should select the paper you will present at least a week in advance
to allow other lab members a chance to read it.
At minimum, your presentation should have a slide per figure
(break large figures into multiple slides to make sure they're legible),
and you should be able to talk through the results
and any methods that may be novel to some people in the lab.</p>
<h3 id="project_specific_meetings" ><a href="#project_specific_meetings"> Project-specific meetings</a></h3><p>Individual projects may have periodic meetings with all of the people involved.
Depending on the needs of the project,
these meetings may be regularly scheduled or ad hoc,
possibly with collaborators.
The needs of this kind of meeting will likely be diverse enough
that it is not worth spelling them out here.</p>
