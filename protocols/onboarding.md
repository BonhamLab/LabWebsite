# New member onboarding

Welcome to the Bonham Lab at Tufts Medical Center!

This is a non-exhaustive guide to getting started
over the first week or two.
Many more details will be included in your first
periodic meetings with Kevin.

## New member form

New members should start by filling out [this form][new-labmember].
This will get the ball rolling on everything else.

If you will need an account on the HPC,
be sure to check the HPC box so that Kevin
can get that paperwork started.

## Github account

If you don't already have one,
you should create a [github account here][github-newuser].

Bookmark the [lab code page](/protocols/code)
and start to familiarize yourself with the lab workflow.
Especially if you are new to coding,
most of it won't make sense,
learning this stuff is a journey,
and it requires lots of practice, so don't try to memorize it or anything.

Once you have filled out your new user form,
Kevin will add you to the [lab github organization][lab-github].

### Trainee repository

You will keep track of goals, projects,
and weekly meetings in your trainee repository.
To do this, create a new repository
using the [trainee template][trainee-template].

Follow the instructions in the README
to set it up.
If you run into problems, don't worry!
Kevin or another lab member will help you
in the first couple of weeks,
and you'll be a pro in no time!

## Zulip account

The lab uses [zulip] to communicate.
Zulip is a bit like slack,
but uses a threaded conversation model.

Notifications are quite customizable,
and you are never expected to respond outside of normal working hours.
Please set notifications
in a way that works best for you -
if Kevin or anyone else sends a message outside of normal business hours,
they should not expect a response until the following day.
Be assured that Kevin has aggressively curated his notifications ðŸ˜‰.
