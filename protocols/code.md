Lab code should be version controlled
and hosted on an online repository (probably [github](https://github.com/bonhamlab)).
If you don't know how to do that, read on!

## Using Git

Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS).
Basically, that means that you keep track of your code on whatever system you're working on,
and then merge with whatever other systems need to have the code.
No individual code location needs to be the "source of truth"
(though in practice we can establish one).

The best way to learn git is to use it.
Kevin will push you to use it frequently,
and if you run into problems, try to solve them on your own,
then ask Kevin to help!

In the meantime, this page has some resources to get you started.
