"I am a computational biologist with a passion for microbial genomics.
I have lived in the Boston area for almost ten years now,
and have experience working in both academia and biotech.
I am excited about genomics, machine learning, and bioinformatics!

In my free time, I like to go on spend time outside,
listen to podcasts, workout, and spend time with my husband and daughter."
