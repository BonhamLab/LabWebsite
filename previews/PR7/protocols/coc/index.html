the core principles that should govern your conduct
in the Bonham Lab are articulated here.
Everything else follows from this set of commitments.</p>
<p>All members of the Bonham Lab (including Kevin)
must conform to the following Code of Conduct.
If you feel you are unable to make any of these commitments,
or if you feel that any member of the lab (including Kevin)
has not lived up to them,
please raise the issue with an appropriate authority
as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="three_fundamental_commitments" ><a href="#three_fundamental_commitments"> Three Fundamental Commitments</a></h3><ol>
<li>Recognizing that many tributaries feed the river of scientific knowledge,
   I will honor my own individuality and the individuality of others.</li>
<li>Realizing that science is at its core an attempt to understand the world as it is,
   I am committed to continuous learning and open exchange of ideas.</li>
<li>Acknowledging the fundamental meaning of any discovery comes from its impact on others, 
   I will respect the integrity of the global scientific community.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="three_guiding_principles" ><a href="#three_guiding_principles"> Three Guiding Principles</a></h3><ul>
<li>I will act in ways that promote scientific integrity and ethical research.</li>
<li>I will cultivate excellence and continuous improvement in my scientific understanding.</li>
<li>I vow to conduct research that benefits all living beings and our shared environment.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ten_core_precepts" ><a href="#ten_core_precepts"> Ten Core Precepts</a></h3><ul>
<li>I will honor and respect all forms of life in my research practices,
  minimizing harm and suffering to human subjects and research organisms.</li>
<li>I will handle research resources, funding, and equipment with care and appropriate stewardship.</li>
<li>I will communicate truthfully about my research methods, results, and interpretations.</li>
<li>I will speak of myself and of colleagues with respect and fairness, building a supportive research environment.</li>
<li>I will share knowledge openly and credit others' contributions appropriately.</li>
<li>I will acknowledge both the accomplishments and limitations of my research findings.</li>
<li>I will cultivate humility regarding my own expertise and remain open to critique and alternative viewpoints.</li>
<li>I will maintain clear boundaries in professional relationships and create a harassment-free environment.</li>
<li>I will use scientific knowledge to benefit society and the environment rather than myself.</li>
<li>I will protect research subjects, vulnerable populations, and ecosystems in all aspects of my work.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="procedures_for_reporting_complaints_or_concerns" ><a href="#procedures_for_reporting_complaints_or_concerns"> Procedures for reporting complaints or concerns</a></h2><p>Do not hesitate to reach out to Kevin formally or informally for any disputes or concerns
arising within the lab, or involving your work for the lab.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ideally, issues or conflicts could be resolved through conversations
  before they get out of hand.
  Do not hesitate to voice concerns, frustrations, or problems
  during your periodic meetings,
  or by scheduling a dedicated meeting to discuss the issue.</li>
<li>Formal reporting should be done via Kevin's hostpital-managed email address
  (<code>*@tuftsmedicine.org</code>) for staff, fellows, or postdocs,
  and via Kevin's University-managed email address (<code>*@tufts.edu</code>) for graduate students.
  Maintaining a "paper" trail for disputes/complaints can be important,
  particularly if you are concerned about behavior persisting.<ul>
<li><strong>You are not ever required to wait or take additional steps before beginning a formal process</strong></li>
<li>If you feel the need to document anything prior to reporting,
    creating a private git repository and making commits,
    or sending emails to yourself with a private email address are good options
    to establish timelines.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Kevin will always endeavor to be your advocate in conflicts with others,
  with the hostpital, or with the school.
  That said, if for any reason you feel that Kevin is not the right advocate
  (or Kevin is the subject of your complaint),
  there are many other options for informal or formal reporting</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="todo_hospital_resources" ><a href="#todo_hospital_resources"> TODO: hospital resources</a></h3><p>These resources are particularly relevant for postdocs, fellows, and staff,
but may also be relevant for students.</p>
<h3 id="university_resources" ><a href="#university_resources"> University resources</a></h3><p>These resources are particularly relevant for students,
but may also be relevant for staff, fellows, and postdocs.</p>

<h2 id="other_codes_of_conduct" ><a href="#other_codes_of_conduct"> Other Codes of Conduct</a></h2><p>Depending on your work, you may also be bound by other codes of conduct or etiquette.
It is your responsibility to familiarize yourself
with the expected behavior in other spaces where you are representing the lab.
